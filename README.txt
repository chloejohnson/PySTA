The objective of this project is to replicate an instrument interface such as 
LabView using Python and a Raspberry Pi, making data collection for small 
experiments more portable, affordable, and user-friendly. 

Specifically, the project aims to measure the accelerations and displacements 
of a cantilever beam, read them into a GUI that that allows simple tasks such 
as filtering or live-streaming the data to create frequency and time-domain 
plots. One of these options will be to create a real time animation of the 
displacement of the beam.
  
CODES:



- ANIMATION:
    Beam_ani.py: animates a 1D beam in its first mode shape from given voltage input of tip displacement
    test3.py: plots the real-time voltage input versus time of a sensor
